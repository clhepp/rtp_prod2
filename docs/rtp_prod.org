* Some Math

Finite difference column jacobians can be obtained from the (gas)
layer analytic jacobians using
$$\delta r = \frac{\partial r}{\partial q_1} \delta q_1 + 
           \frac{\partial r}{\partial q_2} \delta q_2 + ... + 
           \frac{\partial r}{\partial q_N} \delta q_N$$

or

$$\delta r = J_{1} \delta q_1 + J_{2} \delta q_2 + ...
               J_{N} \delta q_N$$ 

* Installation

This is for the user that wants to install and use kCARTA as quickly as
possible. We purposely keep this user manual short, and ask the user to
examine the =user_set*.m= codes in the =Test= subdirectory in orderto
understand how to use the package.

The distribution is divided into three parts :

-  Matlab source on [[http://github.com/strow/kcarta-matlab][github]].

-  kCompressed Database: about 600Mb, supplied via our ftp site. We
   supply two versions, big or little endian.

The =Test= directory contains =matlab_test_desert_0725_2004.mat= which
is a radiance computation coming from running the =dokcarta_downlook.m=
in that directory.
